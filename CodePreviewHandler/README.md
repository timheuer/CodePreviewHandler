CodePreviewHandler
==================

[![Build status](http://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ni43t86jj5d3ql5t)](http://ci.appveyor.com/project/TimHeuer/codepreviewhandler)

This is code for a Windows PreviewHandler file association. 
This enables you to have a preview window in Explorer or Outlook when selecting a file and it will show code-highlighting for the file without opening into some editor.
